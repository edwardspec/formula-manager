Formula Manager.

Mathematical library in C:
	formula parsing,
	integrals, derivatives,
	solving equations, etc.

See formula.h for common stuff (parsing / construction of complex formulas),
	min1var.h - golden section search,
	rungekutta.h - Runge-Kutta method,
	integral.h - integral calculation via Simpson's and Trapezoidal rules.

Non-mathematical headers:
	formula_internal.h, symtable.h - internal (used in formula parsing),
	mpool.h - memory pool implementation.

Enjoy.

'test_eval' utility:
	checks how the formula is parsed and calculates its value.

	Example:
		./test-eval '$[tg(B/4)^A+C]dB|0_3.14' 10 3

	Parses given formula, shows its structure, calculates its value
	in point A=10, C=3. (Note: B is not an argument because of the
	definite integral by B in place).

I wrote this in 2010 while studying [Computational science] and [Mathematical
optimization] at the Obninsk State Technical University (MEPhI Obninsk)
where I was doing Applied Mathematics.

I used this library in some of the practical tasks we did (see labs directory).

Published in 2015 (accidentally found this library while looking through my
code archives; surprisingly good stuff...).
