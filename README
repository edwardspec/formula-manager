Formula Manager.

Mathematical library in C:
	formula parsing,
	integrals, derivatives,
	solving equations, etc.

See formula.h for common stuff (parsing / construction of complex formulas),
	min1var.h - golden section search,
	rungekutta.h - Runge-Kutta method,
	integral.h - integral calculation via Simpson's and Trapezoidal rules.

Non-mathematical headers:
	formula_internal.h, symtable.h - internal (used in formula parsing),
	mpool.h - memory pool implementation.

Enjoy.

I wrote this in 2010 while studying [Computational science] and [Mathematical
optimization] at the Obninsk State Technical University (MEPhI Obninsk)
where I was doing Applied Mathematics.

I used this library in some of the practical tasks we did (see labs directory).

Published in 2015 (accidentally found this library while looking through my
code archives; surprisingly good stuff...).
